2. Setup the Pi

3. The code is not yet migrated to Jack, so come back soon



If Jack does not pan out, considering also using: https://app.assembla.com/wiki/show/portaudio/Platforms_RaspberryPi

Install that from http://www.portaudio.com/download.html and then https://crates.io/crates/sound_stream
